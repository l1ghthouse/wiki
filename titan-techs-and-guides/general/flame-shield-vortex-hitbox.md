  Vortex shield's radius doesn't cover entire ion's body, when standing. This
  allows titans like legion/Monarch (hitscan weapon titans) to land their
  hitscan rounds(this includes close range powershot)

# Flame Shield/Vortex Hitbox

{% hint style="info" %}
* It is easier to hit scorch due to the titan chassis being larger, and the flame shield having less radius than the vortex shield&#x20;
* This works more consistently when enemy ion/scorch are at the elevation since shield covers less ground(and vice-versa, when ion/scorch are standing lower)
