  Vortex Shield's radius doesn't cover entire Ion's body, when standing. This
  allows titans like Legion/Monarch (hitscan weapon titans) to land their
  hitscan rounds(this includes close range Power Shot)

# Thermal/Vortex Shield Hitbox

{% hint style="info" %}
* It is easier to hit Scorch due to the titan chassis being larger, and the Flame Shield having smaller radius than the Vortex Shield&#x20;
* This works more consistently when enemy Ion/Scorch is at the elevation since shield covers less ground(and vice-versa, when Ion/Scorch is standing lower)
