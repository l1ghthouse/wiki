# Quick Swap

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUvkELBEP8" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are on MKB, binding crouch to SCROLLWHEELDOWN(as a secondary key) in the game: The advantage SCROLLWHEELDOWN has is you crouch for less time, but in exchange, you're unable to trigger Quick Swap via uncrouching.

(Note, this isn't a macro since you bind SCROLLWHEELDOWN in-game, not via external software).&#x20;

Make sure to scroll the wheel ONLY after you use the ability (e.g., press shield â†’ SCROLLWHEELDOWN, not the other way around).

Note: Quick Swap does not apply to lowering abilities, only primary weapons.
