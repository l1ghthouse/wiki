  Ability Blocking is similar to ability despawning, except that the ability
  isn't blocked around the place where it spawns.

# Ability Blocking

{% hint style="info" %}
Example of abilities that can be blocked:

* Arcwave
* Flamewall
* Flame core
* many more...
{% endhint %}

For instance, scorches' flame core could be despawned with help of the geometry by blocking all 3 flame core lanes at the same time:

right most lane blocked by geometry, 2 left lanes blocked by shield
{% endembed %}

Example of blocking arcwave with vortex:

(1:18)
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Crouching increases the consistency of blocking the arcwaves.&#x20;
* Moving while blocking arcwave increases the chance of getting hit by arcwave (1:24)
* Releasing shield too early will after block will not block the arcwave (1:30)
{% endhint %}
