# Ability Blocking

{% hint style="info" %}
Example of abilities that can be blocked:

* Arc Wave
* Firewall
* Flame Core
* many more...
{% endhint %}

To block Arc Wave, Firewall, and Flame Core, the wave must be held in place for its remaining duration. Flame Core has 3 waves that must be blocked.

For instance, Scorch's Flame Core can be despawned with help of the geometry by blocking all 3 Flame Core waves at the same time:

Right and left waves blocked by geometry, center wave blocked by shield
{% endembed %}

Example of blocking Arc Wave with Vortex:

(1:18)
{% endembed %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Crouching increases the consistency of blocking waves.&#x20;
* Moving away or releasing shield too soon will allow the wave to continue and damage the player. (1:24, 1:30)
