  Both Lasershot, Siphon, and Lasercore have splash damage. This means, that it
  is not necessary for you to exactly hit the target. As long as the splash
  reaches the target, the damage will be dealt.

(20:29, note how the both siphons hit the ground next to ion, yet they registered as a full hit)
