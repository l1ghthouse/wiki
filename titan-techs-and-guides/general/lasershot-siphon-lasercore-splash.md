  Both Laser Shot, Siphon, and Laser Core have splash damage. This means it is
  not necessary for you to hit the target exactly. As long as the splash reaches
  the target, damage will be dealt.

# Laser Shot/Siphon/Laser Core Splash

(20:29) Note how both siphons hit the ground next to Ion, yet they registered as a full hit.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Laser Core's splash damage has falloff. The closer the splash to the target, the more damage it will deal.
* This can be used in tandem with [Flame Shield/Vortex Hitboxes](flame-shield-vortex-hitbox.md).
