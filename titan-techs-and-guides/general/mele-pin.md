# Melee Pin

If you are being melee pinned (where an opposing titan is constantly meleeing you and thus cancelling your melee attacks), there are two ways to escape it. First, simply dashing away and getting of their melee's reach. Second, you can wait until right after their melee connects, then perform your melee attack while theirs is winding down. This will swap the pin to your favor, forcing your opponent to respond instead.

The player is being pinned by another titan behind them. Note how the player's melee fails to hit a different titan altogether.
