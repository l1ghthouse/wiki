# âš  Doomskip

Upon reaching the doom state there is a chance that the titan explodes instantly, bypassing the doom state completely. However, it is inconsistent, occurring most often if multiple attacks simultaneously damage the titan when it is being doomed, especially if one or more are attacks that hit rapidly.

Doomskip tends to occur more frequently when E-smoke and/or XO-16 are involved.
