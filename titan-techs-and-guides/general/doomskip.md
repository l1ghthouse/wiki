# âš  Doomskip

Upon reaching the doom state, there is a chance that the titan explodes instantly, bypassing the doom state completely. It is inconsistent, however, there are a few factors that contribute to the chances of doomskip occurring. Specifically, if the titan approaching the doom state is being hit by multiple sources at the same time, there is a good chance for a doomskip to occur.

XO-16 and e-smoke have a higher chance of triggering doomskip.
