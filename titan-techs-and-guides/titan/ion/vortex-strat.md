  Ion's vortex can catch rounds from friendly hitscan weapons. Thus, Ion can use
  friendly pilots or titans to "feed" its own shield, and then reflect it at the
  enemies. Vortex amplifier could be useful

# Vortex Strat

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1tQ-D0uLTo" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Optimal loadout for pilot is r-97(fastest hit-scan pilot weapon) with the extended mag, and the quick reload&#x20;
* Vortex has a cap of 31 bullets that it can hold&#x20;
* If you are performing this strat with a friendly legion, you can save some shield energy by starting with a PowerShot, which instantly loads 16 bullets into the ion's shield. Powershot also helps to coordinate the strat better, since it gives a visual queue to ion.
