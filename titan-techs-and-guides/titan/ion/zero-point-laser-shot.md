{% hint style="info" %}
Oftentimes running Zero-Point Tripwire is still more beneficial even though you lose the ability to utilize the Zero-Point Laser Shot glitch. The glitch requires Ion to play at a lower energy level and lower Vortex Shield which is riskier and not as helpful for Ion's frontline role.
