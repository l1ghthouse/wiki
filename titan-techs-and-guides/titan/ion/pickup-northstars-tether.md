# ðŸŸ© Pickup Northstar's Tether

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/fRVbE2SQFjU?t=548" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Picked-up tethers are invulnerable to any damage.
* Tethers do not have the despawn timer reset upon being picked up, and will expire faster than a newly placed tether
* It helps to crouch, and "wiggle" the shield a bit during tether pickup.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Northar should attempt to place the tethers where ion can not pick them up
{% endhint %}
