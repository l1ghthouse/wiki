# ðŸŸ¥ Sword Block Pierce

> If we set the middle of Ronin's back to be 0 degrees, then from about 10 degrees to the left to 60 degrees to the right this bug can be applied. The attack has a decent chance to completely ignore the block and deal full damage. Not every attack can pierce block, and not all of them have been tested. However, from what I've tested, pretty much every explosive attack barring Core Abilities has the ability to do this, and any hitscan weapon (except maybe not Laser Shot, haven't tested it) as well as Ion's splitter rifle can do this as well. Basically, if a Monarch, Ion, Tone or Legion is pounding your back, make sure to turn yourself to the left just a tad, otherwise you can find yourself taking far more damage than you normally would.

Adding to the above: Ronin's legs, specifically the bottom parts of toes can be sword pierced very consistently. Things like long-range PowerShot explosions, satchels in CTF, ion's laser core, can abuse this to potentially increase damage output when ronin is sword blocked
