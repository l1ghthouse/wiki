# ðŸŸ© Quick Draw/Stalled Power Shot

> Stalled Power Shot (Legion): With an unspooled Predator Cannon, pressing Power Shot and fire will cause the Power Shot charge animation to play over the spool animation.
>
> Quickdraw Power Shot (Legion): Has a close relation with the "Stalled Power Shot" bug. You can start charging Power Shot before the Predator Cannon can fire. This is what produces the "double charge" thing that Stalled Power Shots produced. However, Quickdraw is the use of this mechanic to time the charge such that it finishes right when the Predator Cannon is able to fire, allowing the Power Shot to fire more quickly from an unspun cannon. A stalled Power Shot from a fully unspun cannon (with the Fire key held throughout the stall) will always perform a perfect Quickdraw Power Shot.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a perfect Quickdraw, begin charging at the 50% mark (0.75s) of the ADS animation. Immediate stalls, as previously mentioned, also cause perfect Quickdraws.

Stalled or failed Quickdraw Power Shots are never slower than a normal Power Shot.
