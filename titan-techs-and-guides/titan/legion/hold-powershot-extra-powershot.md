# ðŸŸ© Hold-Powershot(Extra Powershot)

{% hint style="info" %}
* Just like Ion's energy recharge glitch, this glitch requires you to embark/disembark. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings prior to performing the glitch. Make sure you are not sacrificing the positional advantage
* It could be easier to perform the glitch by Holding PowerShot as soon as the embark animation starts, and releasing PowerShot button only when the screen fading (instead of doing it all when the screen is fading)
