  Scorch is able to increase the speed of reloading by flickering the shield as
  soon as the thermite round is loaded into the chamber. The shield flickering
  can also be sped up via Quick Swap.

# ðŸŸ© Scorch Reload Cancel

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/MvUvkELBEP8?t=55" %}
(0:55-1:12) Notice how Reload Cancel + Quick Swap is faster than Reload Cancel, which in turn is faster than Normal reload.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Thermite Launcher can be ADS'd during the raise animation, eliminating the need to wait for ADS before firing.
* Performing a reload cancel will trigger Thermal Shield's cooldown delay and activation cost, slowing its cooldown.
* Cannot be performed if your Thermal Shield has too little charge to activate (<20%).
