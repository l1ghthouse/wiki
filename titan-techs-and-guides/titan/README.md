### Escaping Destroyed Titan

Ejecting isn't always the best way to escape your titan. When you are unprotected in the sky with Iong range titans. You often risk being killed before getting use from your pilot or simply stay out-of-the-fight too long when you team needs help. You have 2 options for opportunity to fight again.

#### Ejecting:

Simply. Ejecting can give you great height to move away or towards another fight, line-of-sight to attack enemies with Anti-Titan weapons.

#### Disembarking:

Simply. Disembarking can override getting executed, confuse the enemy, covers pilot model with explosion visual effect, allow you to get to safety quicker, or let you stay in the fight to help your team.

### Titan Kits.

This isn't a absolute value list of the kits. Turbo Engine can be better than Overcore, just as Overcore can be better than Turbo Engine. Now with that.&#x20;

#### 1. Overcore

> Titan Core always starts with 20% build time.

Overcore is the safest/best kit. Titan core is a high value factor in a fight. Having a headstart to your strongest attack is incredibly strong. Use Overcore if you arent sure.

#### 2. Turbo Engine

> Ronin, Northstar, Monarch, Ion & Tone: 1 extra dash.
>
> Scorch & Legion: Reduced dash cooldown from 10s to 5s.

Both an extra dash or reduced dash cooldown (from 15 seconds to 8 seconds) can exchange an Overcore Titan Kit in certain situations. Although Ogre type titans lose a lot of team rotational and engagement value without Turbo Engine. Use Turbo Engine for Ogre titans.

#### 3. Counter Ready

> 1 extra Electric Smoke countermeasure.

Although Counter Ready isn't the best. Counter Ready can still provide value with pilot rodeoing, extra damage ability shortly after using core, and can block off visuals for or of the enemy. Its better than Stealth Auto-Eject, Nuclear Ejection, and Assault Chip.&#x20;
