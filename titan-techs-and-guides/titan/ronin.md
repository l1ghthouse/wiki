# Ronin

## Meta Kits.

Choices higher up in the list are generally a safer and/or less situational option.

### Titan Kit:

#### Overcore:

Starting with an extra 20% core into the progression of one of the strongest cores. Serves great postive advantage for you towards the whole fight.&#x20;

### Ronin Kit:

#### Thunderstorm:

> Arc Wave has two charges.

Thunderstorm adding a second Arc wave is great due to arc waves incredible uses. Arc waves are used to keep a opponent still. Gives Ronin more ranged options. Goes under shields. Travel over buildings with map tech. Removing Legion Gun Shield and Tone Particle Shield.

#### Temporal Anomaly:

> Phase Dash is available more often (shorter cooldown).

Against better players. Map selection and understanding. Having a shorter Phase Dash cooldown can let you engage, punish, maneuver, disengage, and help you cover more distance in a fight.&#x20;
