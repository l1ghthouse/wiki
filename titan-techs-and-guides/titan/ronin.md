# Ronin

## Meta Kits.

Choices higher up in the list are generally safer and are less situational.

### Titan Kit:

#### Overcore:

Starting with an extra 20% core into the progression of one of the strongest cores. Serves great postive advantage for you towards the whole fight.&#x20;

### Ronin Kit:

#### Thunderstorm:

> Arc Wave has two charges.

Adding a second Arc Wave is great due to arc waves incredible uses. Arc waves are used to keep an opponent still. Gives Ronin more ranged options. Goes under shields. Travel over buildings with map tech. Removing Legion Gun Shield and Tone Particle Shield.

#### Temporal Anomaly:

> Phase Dash is available more often (shorter cooldown).

Against better players. Map selection and understanding. Having a shorter Phase Dash cooldown can let you engage, punish, maneuver, disengage, and help you cover more distance in a fight.&#x20;
