# ðŸŸ¥ Prime Execution

{% hint style="danger" %}
On certain maps like rise, Northstar has a chance of being destroyed while it is executing an enemy titan. This happens due to Northstar clipping into the roof during the execution Enemy Ions are able to catch rockets from Northstar's execution, and redirect them back, exerting \~3 bars of damage.
