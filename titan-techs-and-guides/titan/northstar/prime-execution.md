# ðŸŸ¥ Prime Execution

{% hint style="danger" %}
On certain maps like Rise, Northstar has a chance of being destroyed while it is executing an enemy titan. This happens due to Northstar clipping into the roof during the execution, hitting instant death zones. Enemy Ions are also able to catch rockets from Northstar's execution and redirect them back, dealing \~3 bars of damage.
{% endhint %}
