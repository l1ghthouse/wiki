A good discussion on Reddit about moonboots: [https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/kud8st/are\_there\_any\_exploits/gisabo7/?utm\_source=share\&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app\&amp;utm\_name=iossmf\&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/kud8st/are\_there\_any\_exploits/gisabo7/?amp%3Butm\_medium=ios\_app\&amp%3Butm\_name=iossmf\&amp%3Bcontext=3)

{% hint style="info" %}
* Moonboots persists until the end of the match, even through death or LTS rounds.
* If Hover or Flight Core is used again and the flight effect ends before disembarking/ejecting, moonboots will also disappear.
{% endhint %}
