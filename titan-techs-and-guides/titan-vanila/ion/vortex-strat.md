  Ion's Vortex can catch rounds from friendly hitscan weapons. Thus, Ion can use
  friendly pilots or titans to “feed” its shield, and then reflect it at the
  enemies.

# 🟩 Vortex Strat

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1tQ-D0uLTo" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* Vortex has separate caps of 31 hitscans and 31 projectiles. The type of bullet caught does not matter for hitscans.
* The optimal weapon for a pilot is the R-97 since it is the fastest firing pilot weapon.
* If you are performing this strat with a friendly legion, you can save some shield energy by starting with a Power Shot, which instantly loads 16 bullets into the ion's shield. Power Shot also helps to coordinate the strat better, since it gives a visual cue to Ion.
