# Northstar

## Meta Kits:

Choices higher up in the list are generally a safer and/or less situational option.

### Titan Kit:

#### Turbo Engine:

Enhances Northstar's potent poking power and mobility to reinforce her passive gameplay, especially on maps where ceilings or obstacles may stifle Hover and Flight Core.

#### Overcore:

Hastens Flight Core build, enabling Northstar to push on priority targets or hold her ground sooner.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Overcore should only be used with Viper Thrusters.
{% endhint %}

### Northstar Kit:

#### Viper Thrusters:

> Increases VTOL Hover and Flight Core max movement speed.
>
> * VTOL Hover max speed is increased by 33%.
> * Flight Core max speed is increased by 60%.
> * Matches sprinting speed.

Enables Northstar to use Hover as a horizontal movement tool rather than a purely poking and map traversal tool. For VTOL Hover, it allows Northstar to maintain top speed while keeping Railgun charged during retreats, evasive maneuvers, pushes, etc. For Flight Core, the speed drastically increases the core's chasing ability, allowing Northstar to stay on top of her target and land her rockets more easily.

#### Twin Traps:

> Deploys two Tether traps at once.
>
> * Tethers are deployed in a V-shape at an upwards angle, rather than straight ahead.

Enhances Northstar's ability to lock down an area making it more difficult for enemies to push through her lanes, especially when traps are staggered via walls. Especially strong at preventing enemies from chasing and tethering Sword Core more reliably.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Viper Thrusters** should not be used on maps with obtrusive ceilings or obstacles where VTOL Hover and Flight Core are stifled, such as Complex.
* While **Enhanced Payload** may seem enticing, it is actually a nerf in nearly all situations.
