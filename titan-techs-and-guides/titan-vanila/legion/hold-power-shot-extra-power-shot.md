{% hint style="info" %}
* Just like Ion's energy recharge glitch, this glitch requires you to embark/disembark. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings before performing the glitch and are not sacrificing positional advantage.
* It can be easier to perform the glitch by holding Power Shot as soon as the embark animation starts and releasing Power Shot button only when the screen is fading (instead of doing it all when the screen is fading).
