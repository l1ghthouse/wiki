# Legion

## Meta kits:

Choices higher up in the list are generally safer and/or less situational.

### Titan Kit:

#### Turbo Engine:

The (10-15s) second dash cooldown on an ogre is very hard and risky choice. Turbo Engine reducing dash to (7-8s) allows you to engage, disengage, position faster/better. Giving Legion a great option in his fights and more forgiving on your positioning.

#### Overcore:

Overcore allows Legion to win more matches or have a match deciding variable sooner. Overcore is often taken as a counter to Ion's; due to quicker reduction of Scorch and Ion's shields.

### Legion Kit:

#### Hidden compartment:

Having 2 of knockback and burst damage utilities is very valuable despite the damage reduction of (20-30%).

#### &#x20;Enhanced Ammo Capacity:

More bullet. More pressure. More wins.

#### &#x20;Light Weight Alloys:

Light Weight Alloys is a great option for pushing and applying pressure to enemies. Allows for Legion to push around corners, push into enemy for damage and core meter. While still aiding to your positioning.&#x20;
