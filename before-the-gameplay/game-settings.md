# Game Settings

## Control Settings

#### Crouch set to mousewheeldown

Because of a very important [titan tech](../vanilla-titan-tech-and-guides/general/quick-swap.md), adding a secondary crouch bound to your mouse's scroll wheel is recommended.

## Audio Settings

#### Dialogue Volume (MP)

The in-game multiplayer dialogue is not important. Lower or mute volume slider.

#### Music Volume (MP)

The in-game multiplayer music is not important. Lower or mute volume slider.

#### Voice Chat Volume (MP)

Many times the open multiplayer voice chat does not provide more value to the match. External voice clients are better. Lower or mute volume slider.

**Sound Occlusion**

Make sure sound occlusion is disabled to allow you better hear sounds behind obstacles.
