#### Secondary Crouch Keybind

Because of how important and highly used is quick swap, it is recommended to add a secondary crouch keybind in a convenient location.

#### Dialogue Volume (MP)

The in-game multiplayer dialogue is not relevant. Lower or mute volume slider.

#### Music Volume (MP)

The in-game multiplayer music is not essential. Lower or mute volume slider.

#### Voice Chat Volume (MP)
