# ðŸŸ© Quickdraw/Stalled Powershot

> Stalled Powershot (Legion): With an unspooled Predator Cannon, pressing Powershot and fire will cause the Powershot charge animation to play over the spool animation.
>
> Quickdraw Powershot (Legion): Has a close relation with the "Stalled Powershot" bug. You can start charging Powershot before the Predator Cannon can fire. This is what produces the "double charge" thing that Stalled Powershots produced. However, Quickdraw is the use of this mechanic to time the charge such that it finishes right when the Predator Cannon is able to fire, allowing the Powershot to fire more quickly from an unspun cannon. A stalled Powershot from a fully unspun cannon (with the Fire key held throughout the stall) will always perform a perfect Quickdraw Powershot.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a perfect Quickdraw, begin charging at the 50% mark (0.75s) of the ADS animation. Immediate stalls, as previously mentioned, also cause perfect Quickdraws.

Stalled or failed Quickdraw Powershots are never slower than a normal Powershot.
