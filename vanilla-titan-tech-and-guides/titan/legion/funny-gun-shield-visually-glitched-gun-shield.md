# ðŸŸ© Funny Gun Shield (Visually Glitched Gun Shield)

Makes your gun shield appear elsewhere visually for the enemy.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Could be utilized to get punished less for peaking with gun shield (enemy will think you have no gun shield and aim directly at it instead of your vents, especially common against Northstars)

Could potentially make it much harder for enemy Tones to splash around your gun shield (they'll most likely shoot at it directly or fail to splash around it since they can't see it properly)
{% endhint %}
