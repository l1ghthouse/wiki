# ðŸŸ© ADS Splitter without damage-reducing attachments

Context: Normally when you split the rifle, you aren't doing full damage with each projectile. Base splitter does 70% per shot, dealing 210% total damage. Refraction lens does 55% per shot, for 275% total damage.

**By holding ADS through its endings of either laser shot, or vortex that has something in it, the damage-reducing wouldn't affect the splitter rifle**. Hence, the splitter does 300% total damage and the refraction lens does 500% total damage
