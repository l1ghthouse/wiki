# ðŸŸ© Full Damage Split Shot

Normally, when you fire split shots with Splitter Rifle, each projectile deals reduced damage. Base splitter does 70% per shot, dealing 210% total damage. Refraction lens does 55% per shot, for 275% total damage.

**By holding ADS through the ending of either Laser Shot or Vortex containing something, the damage reduction will not apply**. Hence, base splitter will do 300% total damage and Refraction Lens will do 500% total damage.
