# Titan

### Abandoning a Doomed Titan

Ejecting isn't always the best way to escape your titan. When you are unprotected in the sky against Iong range titans, you'll most likely bite the dust before getting use from your pilot or are simply out of the fight for too long when your team needs help. You have 2 options for opportunity to fight again.

#### Ejecting:

Ejecting gives you great height to move away or towards another fight and line-of-sight to attack enemies with Anti-Titan weapons.

#### Disembarking:

Disembarking keeps you low and in place, letting you stay in the fight to help your team or quickly reach cover. If your titan dies simultaneously, it can also confuse the enemy and cover the pilot model with the titan's death explosion visual effect (works against smart core, only if you disembark backwards to them), allowing you to get to safety.

### Titan Kits

Turbo Engine and Overcore are almost always superior to all other general titan kits, but neither one is objectively the best. Certain titans and playstyles may prefer one over the other.&#x20;

#### 1. Overcore

> Titan Core always starts with 20% build time.

Overcore is the safest/best kit. Titan core is a high-value factor in a fight; having a head start to your strongest attack is incredibly strong. Additionally, the base 20% core build gives you smoke immediately after spawning or using core. For non-Ogre titans, this is a safe choice.

#### 2. Turbo Engine

> Ronin, Northstar, Monarch, Ion & Tone: 1 extra dash.
>
> Scorch & Legion: Reduced dash cooldown from 10s to 5s.

The extra dash can be preferable for titans which have weaker cores, whose kits benefit abnormally from it, or for strategies which value fast/early pushing. For Ogre titans, however, the cooldown reduction is a direct increase to their mobility that enables faster repositioning and more frequent dash pokes. As such, it is almost always preferred over Overcore for Ogres.
