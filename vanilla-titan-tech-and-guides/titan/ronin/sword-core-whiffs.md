# ðŸŸ¥ Sword Core Whiffs

While using Sword Core, if Ronin uses Arc Wave or Sword Block, then melee's immediately afterwards, the melee swing will deal no damage. This also occurs if you melee right after the core begins. To avoid this, simply wait a half second or so to melee after using Arc Wave or Sword Block during Ronin's core.
