# ðŸŸ¥ Sword Core Whiffs

Ronin's Sword during Sword Core is bugged, leading to the melee attack phasing right through the enemy, dealing no damage. This is caused by pressing or holding the melee button while a previous animation is playing. This includes Arc Wave, Sword Block, the animation that plays after starting Sword Core, or even other melee attacks. To avoid this bug, wait until after any previous animation finishes before pressing melee. This bug appears to happen more often when the user holds the melee button down, rather than spamming said button, but it can happen either way.
