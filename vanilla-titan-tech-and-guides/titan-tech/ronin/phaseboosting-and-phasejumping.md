# ðŸŸ© Phaseboosting and Phasejumping

Phase Dash has some odd properties that can be utilized for two separate techniques.

First, the Phaseboost. By dashing, then phase-dashing just a few frames after, you will perform a fast and lengthy dash, as if the two dashes have stacked their speed together. By crouching in midair, the player will be in midair for longer, increasing distance further. Continuing to hold crouch also allows the player to slide on the ground for a short distance upon landing. In reality, the speed doesn't actually stack. Phase Dash makes the player travel much faster/farther when the player is airborne. Dashing actually causes the titan to be airborne for a split-second, leading to the phaseboost. Walking off a ledge and phasedashing results in the same thing. Dashing while you're using phase-dash does not increase speed. This is an incredibly useful technique for engaging, disengaging, or moving around the map more quickly.

Secondly, the Phasejump. Phasejumping can only be performed in very specific spots, and results in Ronin flying upwards vertically. It's performed in the opposite way that Phaseboosting is: you must first phase-dash, then dash a few frames later. This technique is significantly less useful, as there are only 2 or 3  locations where jumping vertically is useful which also have the exact kind of collision required to perform it. Still, it looks cool as hell, and that's all that matters.

This video shows most (but not all) of the known spots for Phasejumping, along with an explanation on how to perform both techniques. Use English captions if you can't speak Russian. Boomtown and Blackwater Canal are the two most useful Phasejumping locations.
