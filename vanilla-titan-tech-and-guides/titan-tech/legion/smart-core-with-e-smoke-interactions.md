# â„¹ Smart core with E-smoke Interactions

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/uMJ_4P7bwOY?t=102" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can utilize your own E-smoke for an advantage to disable lock on with smart core to make shooting titans standing behind obstacles above chest height possible or when trying to shoot around gun shield.

Could also be used to make criting easier, gl doing it blind. (If only you had a Tone teammate use their sonar)
