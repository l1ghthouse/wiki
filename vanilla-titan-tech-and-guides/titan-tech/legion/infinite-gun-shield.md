# ðŸŸ© Infinite Gun Shield

To activate, disembark at roughly between 2.0 â€“ 3.8 sec left of gun shield timer for best result. Disembarking later will reduce the amount of gun shield cooldown refreshed. In contrary, disembarking too early will pause the cooldown and restart it once you regain control.

HUD Revamp Mod is recommended because it has ability cooldown timers as shown in video.&#x20;
