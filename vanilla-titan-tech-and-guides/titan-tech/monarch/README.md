# Monarch

## Meta Kits

Turbo Engine: Greatly improves monarch's mobility. Rearm recharges both dashes, so Turbo Engine + Rapid Rearm is a super powerful combo.

Overcore: Really good for obvious reasons, but because Arc Rounds are the only core upgrade that really matters (as it's very hard to reach core 3), this kit isn't as good as it is in pubs.

### Meta monarch build:

Turbo engine

Arc rounds, Reload Re-arm, Accelerator.

Rapid Rearm is meta for LTS, Energy Thief is meta for Titan Brawl. Either is viable for other modes (Rapid Rearm for stronger initial power, Energy Thief for snowball)
