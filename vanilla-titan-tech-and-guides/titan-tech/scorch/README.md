# Scorch

## Meta Kits

### Turbo Engine:

Turbo Engine is a flat requirement on Scorch. No other kit comes even close to being as useful as this one does. Turbo Engine reducing dash to 5s allows you to engage, disengage, position faster/better, and poke with dashes more freely. It also allows Scorch to get in and out with Flame Shield easier.

### Scorch Kits:

#### Wildfire Launcher:

(Effects: Thermite deals 35% more damage, Multiplies thermite spread by 4x)

While Scorch usually relies on extremely damaging, but close range attacks such as [Heat Shield](https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/Heat\_Shield), **Wildfire Launcher** significantly increases his threat range by increasing his primary weapon's damage. This allows him to take on passive play fights much, much better and become applicable on way more maps and scenarios than he otherwise would be. The downside is that Scorch loses some of his close-range threat as a result, allowing Ion and Legion to take him on much more confidently in close quarters, but the downside is fairly minimal compared to the benefits.

Wildfire Launcher is often considered to be Scorch's best kit in competitive play, as enemy titans are often smart enough to always avoid Scorch's fire traps and heat shield, leaving his primary as his only option. However, in most normal games, players are not as coordinated or aware, making it somewhat less effective there. Regardless, Wildfire Launcher's effect should not be underestimated.

### **Tempered Plating**:

(Effects: Negates all self-damage from [Scorch's](https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/Scorch) Thermite, whilst also removing his critical hitbox.)

This kit contributes greatly to an aggressive play style, allowing players to pass through their own thermite and give chase unharmed, or improve their chances of trapping an opponent. Setting the ground on fire and cornering an enemy titan with a [Thermal Shield](https://titanfall.fandom.com/wiki/Thermal\_Shield) can result in some truly ludicrous damage, while the Scorch takes no self damage like he usually would for standing in his own flames.

Far more risks can be taken, given the invulnerability to critical hits.
