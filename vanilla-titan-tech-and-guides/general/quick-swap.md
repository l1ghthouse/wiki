# Quick Swap

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUvkELBEP8" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are on MKB, binding crouch to SCROLLWHEELDOWN(as a secondary key) in the game allows you to perform micro-crouch animation, aka on SCROLLWHEELDOWN, your titan will crouch and un-crouch instantly making a quick swap without slowing down your titan.&#x20;

(Note, this isn't a macro since you bind SCROLLWHEELDOWN in-game, not via external software).&#x20;

Make sure to scroll the wheel ONLY after you use the ability (e.g. press shield -> SCROLLWHEELDOWN, not the other way around).

Note: Quick Swap does not apply to lowering abilities, only primary weapons.
