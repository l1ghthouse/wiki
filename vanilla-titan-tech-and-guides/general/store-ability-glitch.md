# Store Ability Glitch

Pressing the same ability key earlier will play the ability animation without any actual effect, hence ghost version.&#x20;

You can also store both energy siphon and missiles at the same time from Monarch, can also store Ronin's arc wave. Not releasing the ability before cooldown ends will reset it.

To activate, hold your fire key, press ability key, release fire key after ability ends.
