  Vortex Shield's radius doesn't cover entire Ion's body when standing. This
  allows titans like Legion/Monarch (hitscan weapon titans) to land their
  hitscan rounds (this includes close range Powershot).

# Thermal/Vortex Shield Hitbox

{% hint style="info" %}
* It is easier to hit Scorch due to the titan chassis being larger and Thermal Shield having a smaller radius than Vortex Shield.
* This works more consistently when the enemy Ion/Scorch is higher than the player since their shield covers less ground (and vice-versa when the enemy Ion/Scorch is lower than the player).
